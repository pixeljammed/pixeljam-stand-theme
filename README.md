## about
### description
- who even uses Stand anymore? the community is dead and they stopped updating it, lmao.
- i've recently clean installed my computer to Arch Linux and i thought it would be a shame if this beautiful theme never saw the light of day again.
- nice pastel pink colours
- cute header with **questionable** helltaker art
- cool smooth animations
- sexy blur background
- epic custom font*


## installation
- Download the source code of this repository (big green top-right-ish button) and drag and drop it into your Stand folder
- Located at `C:/Users/*YOUR USER*/AppData/Roaming/Stand`
- Replace if prompted

### (optional) custom font
- Install the [PixeljamSans](https://github.com/pixeljammed/pixeljam-stand-theme/raw/refs/heads/main/PixeljamSans.otf) font. It should have downloaded with the theme.
- On Windows open the .otf and click install.
- In Stand settings go to Settings > Appearance > Text > Font and input PixeljamSans as the custom font. Failing that, try BuilderSans.
